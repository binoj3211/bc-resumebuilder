# Google OAuth Setup Guide

To enable Google OAuth authentication in your ATS Resume Builder, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API (or Google Sign-In API)

## 2. Configure OAuth 2.0

1. Go to "Credentials" in the Google Cloud Console
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen first if prompted
4. Choose "Web application" as the application type
5. Add authorized origins:
   - `http://localhost:5174` (for development)
   - Your production domain (when deployed)
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:5174` (for development)
   - Your production domain (when deployed)

## 3. Get Your Client ID

After creating the OAuth client, you'll get a Client ID that looks like:
`1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.apps.googleusercontent.com`

## 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
```

## 5. Update AuthContext

The AuthContext is already configured to use the Google Client ID from environment variables. Make sure to replace the placeholder in the GoogleOAuthProvider component.

## 6. Backend Setup (Required for Full Functionality)

To make authentication work properly, you'll need to set up a backend API with endpoints for:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Manual login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration  
- `POST /api/auth/google` - Google OAuth verification
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/resumes` - Save resume
- `GET /api/resumes` - Get user resumes
- `PUT /api/resumes/:id` - Update resume
- `DELETE /api/resumes/:id` - Delete resume

The frontend is already configured to make API calls to these endpoints.

## 7. Test the Authentication

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" in the header
3. Test both Google OAuth and manual authentication
4. Verify that user session persists on page refresh

Note: Without a backend, the authentication will work in demo mode using localStorage, but data won't persist between sessions or be shared across devices.
